# proposal for a trump rating function for Doppelkopf
# The core function calculate_trump_power applies the formula  p = (c_q*q + n + c_t*t)/c to calculate the trump rating (p) as weighted sum of trump quality (q), quantity (n) and the number of unbeatable trumps (t). Unbeatable card hands get a trump power of 100 (normalization factor (c) is set accordingly). Trump quality is numerically expressed using an arctan-function (details see below).
# main() sets a test frame with randomly assigned cards to four players. The sorted card hands and their respective trump ratings appear in the output.
